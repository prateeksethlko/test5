# --- Application Initialization for Gunicorn (Modified) ---
# When using an application factory, it's often more reliable to have Gunicorn
# directly call the factory function.
# We will no longer assign `app = create_app(...)` at the global scope directly.
# Instead, the Gunicorn startup command will be adjusted to call this function.

# The 'app' variable is still used here for local development,
# but in Azure, Gunicorn will use the specific startup command.
# For local debugging, we still need a global 'app' object if __name__ == '__main__' runs.
# However, for deployment, Gunicorn will directly use 'app:create_app()'.

# We'll define a variable that Gunicorn can "find" which is actually the result
# of calling create_app. This is a common pattern when the factory requires
# configuration at runtime.
# Here, 'application' is a common alternative name for the WSGI callable.
# We set this up to call create_app with the appropriate environment.
# Gunicorn can then be instructed to look for 'application'.
